## WELCOME TO RUBY TECHNICAL APPLICATION

Thank you for submitting your written application to Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development program. As the next step, we'd like for you to complete a series of labs that will assess your skills in Ruby. We don't expect you to be an expert, but below are the topics that will be covered over the course of these five labs: 

1. Variables
2. Conditional Statements
3. Arrays
4. Looping 
5. Methods and Functions


If you're a complete beginner or need to brush up on your skills in these and other beginner level topics, check out our free Introduction to Ruby course that'll give you the foundation to successfully complete this application track.  

Remember to follow the workflow for solving labs that we covered in the Welcome to Learn track. If you experience any product issues (for example, are your lights not working? Are you having trouble opening labs? Are you having trouble submitting labs?) please email support@learn.co. If you feel that there are problems with the actual lesson content, then please submit an issue via Learn. 

If you're applying to our immersive, in-person program, you may be contacted for an interview with a Flatiron School instructor after completing the track. 

Good luck and happy coding!
